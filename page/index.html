          </div>

          <p>Welcome to our 2024 Programming PA Media Design Project! We've built a productivity app inspired from students just like us that aims to help people stay on top of their work as well as avoid distractions.</p>

          <p>There are three main pages that we've implemented, but there's always the potential for more features to come in the future. So far we have:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule</span> page, which allows users to add tasks to their schedule, complete with date and time selection. Events can also be protected (sleeping or lunch are good examples of this) and are not touched by the automatic pushback system, which we explain elsewhere. In addition, using some statistics, we can give a more accurate readout of how long any specified task will take compared to the time for which the user enters.</li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Events</span> page allows users to view the events or tasks that they have added in the previously mentioned page. This page shows the dates and times of tasks, has them sorted, and if the user clicks on a task it will toggle between completed and todo.</li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tracked Sites</span> page allows users to customize and configure how they want to best avoid distractions. Whenver the extension is open, the extension will attempt to block the user from opening any of the sites they have specified. This means that the user either has a set time limit for the sites, or if the auto-close option is selected, the page will close immediately by itself, permitting absolutely no distractions. One can also set the time limit for all websites and even see how long they've spent on the websites for the day.</li>
          </ul>
